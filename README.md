# Inspectr

We're developing an app that takes restaurant inspection data from publicly available websites and makes it easy to access to the public.  We are planning to contribute data to Socrata OpenData the data to OpenStreetMap.   We're starting with Atlanta, then scaling to Georgia.  This project started on 6/6/15 at the Atlanta Hack for Change event.
